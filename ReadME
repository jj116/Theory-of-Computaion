All the Modules have been completed.

For the first module we took in the pattern and compared it to the string which we take a input and check if 
the pattern is found in the string.

For the Second module we input the NFA and implement the Thompson Algorithm.

For the Third Module we created a GUI which represents a State Machine using JPanel.
